About:

The unconvert program analyzes Go packages to find and remove type
conversion expressions T(x) where x already has type T.

Optionally, using the -all flag, unconvert will analyze the Go
packages under all possible GOOS/GOARCH combinations, and only remove
conversions that are redundant in all cases.

E.g., syscall.Timespec's Sec and Nsec fields are int64 under
linux/amd64 but int32 under linux/386.  An int64(ts.Sec) conversion
that appears in a linux/amd64-only file will be identified as
redundant, but it will be preserved if it occurs in a file that's
compiled for both linux/amd64 and linux/386.

Install:

    go get github.com/mdempsky/unconvert

Usage:

    unconvert -all `go list std cmd`
